### IACR Statement.

I hope to give back to the community as an IACR director, with the
overaching goal of improving our professional and personal well-being
---especially that of PhD students and junior reseachers--- through
(i) better and healthier conference reviewing, (ii) stronger
bi-directional engagement with industry, and (iii) building a more
cohesive community.

### Longer Statement

Cryptography and the IACR, along with coffee, has been a big part of
my professional life in the US (Berkeley, CUNY, Algorand, NTT
Research), Europe (CNRS/ENS, RUB), and Asia (Tsinghua). I would like to
give back to the community as an IACR director, with the overaching
goal of improving our professional and personal well-being ---especially that
of PhD students and junior reseachers--- through (i)
better and healthier conference reviewing, (ii) stronger
bi-directional engagement with industry, and (iii) building a more
cohesive community.
