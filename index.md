### #JeSuisWee

I hope to give back to the community as an IACR director, with the
overaching goal of improving our professional and personal well-being
---especially that of students and junior reseachers--- through
(i) better and healthier conference reviewing, (ii) stronger
bi-directional engagement with industry, and (iii) building a more
cohesive community.

### Longer Statement

Cryptography and the IACR, along with coffee, has been a big part of
my professional life in the US (Berkeley, CUNY, Algorand, NTT
Research), Europe (CNRS/ENS, RUB), and Asia (Tsinghua). I would like to
give back to the community as an IACR director, with the overaching
goal of improving our professional and personal well-being ---especially that
of PhD students and junior reseachers--- through

* *Better and healthier conference reviewing*:
guidance for first-time PC chairs and PC members; pathway to PCs for junior researchers; incentivizing good reviews, active PC/reviewer discussion; engaging senior researchers; looking at and reviewing recent initiatives like discussion leads and area chairs, as well as investigating new ones like 2-tier PCs; top 10% award for flagship conferences.

* *Stronger
bi-directional engagement with industry*:
making sure our research is informed by real-world and industry needs and vice versa to ensure continuing impact; ensuring IACR community is perceived as an expert opinion on all things cryptography;
career opportunities for PhD students and junior researchers;

* *Building a more
cohesive community*: 
cultivating appreciation for research done across IACR communities; facilitating student internships, visits, exchanges and conference social activities across institutions and continents.
