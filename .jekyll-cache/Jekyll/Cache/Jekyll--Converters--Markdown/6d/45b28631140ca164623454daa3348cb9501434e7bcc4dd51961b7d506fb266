I"V<h3 id="iacr-statement">IACR Statement</h3>

<p>Cryptography and the IACR, along with coffee, has been a big part of
my professional life in the US (Berkeley, CUNY, Algorand, NTT
Research), Europe (CNRS/ENS, RUB), and Asia (Tsinghua). I would like to
give back to the community as an IACR director, with the overaching
goal of improving our professional and personal well-being —especially that
of PhD students and junior reseachers— through (i)
better and healthier conference reviewing, (ii) stronger
bi-directional engagement with industry, and (iii) building a more
cohesive community.</p>
